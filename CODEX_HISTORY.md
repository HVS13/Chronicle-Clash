# Codex History

This file preserves the historical intent and decisions for Chronicle Clash. Append a new entry after each Codex task so future changes keep the original reasons intact.

## Project Intent
- Maintain Chronicle Clash documentation as the source of truth.
- Keep the site focused on rules, reference pages, and content authoring guidance.
- Preserve the export tooling for page and all-pages downloads.

## Information Architecture
- Primary content lives in `docs/`.
- MkDocs theme overrides live in `docs/overrides/`.
- Client-side helpers live in `docs/javascripts/`.
- Styles live in `docs/stylesheets/`.
- `site/` is generated output and should not be edited directly.

## Log
- 2026-01-02: Initialized Chronicle Clash documentation baseline and aligned agent + skill guidance for the new project.
